<u>Note concerning jesters</u>: leveling a jester is probably harder than leveling another class. They cannot hit the monsters. Most likely, they will only do one damage when striking. But they have puppet monsters to fight with them. You need to have a puppet equipped to get it working. Each puppet summons a specific monster. However, jesters will not get XP if they don't attack the oponent and let the puppet monster do all the job. In my mind, the best leveling strategy is to spend all his ability points to train wisdom, raise his level in battle magic to level 3 and get some debuff spells. Then no need to attack the monsters anymore. Just debuff them. The puppet monster will kill them for you but you'll get XP and PP. Train the other classes as you would train any class in Well of Souls.
