H: What's wrong with you?!
H: Don't be afraid, I don't want to kill you!
1: So you're not with the aralian guards?
H: No, I'm not.
H: What happened to you?
1: A long story, that is.
1: I tried to lay my hands on a very rare and precious crystal, hidden somewhere in the valley.
1: But the aralian guards were here, and almost killed me.
1: I succeeded in running away, and since then I have been tracked and hassled by those birds of the devil!
H: Interesting.
H: And where is this crystal?
1: Do you want to try to get it?
H: Maybe.
1: So listen: on the top of the first rocky piton of the valley, there is a den of the aralian guards.
1: If you succeed in climbing the piton, you'll find the crystal.
1: But beware: the aralian guards will be waiting for you as well!
1: If you bring it here, I could use its power to forge a magical piece of equipment for you.
H: Deal!
