1: Hello, foreigner.
1: We knew you would come.
H: Yeah I seem to be famous in the region...
1: We are the Azeris, guards of Aralshek's sepulchre.
1: For centuries, we've guarded the place and made sure that Aralshek stays asleep.
1: But a few months ago, another foreigner came.
1: I don't know who he was but he was not human.
1: We fought him but he was animated by surnatural powers.
1: Many of my men died, and most of those who survived died thereafter.
1: The foreigner went to Aralshek's sepulchre and woke him up.
1: Some of my companions went to the town to inform the Grand Priest of the temple.
1: And he told us that you would come, with Taj Isha's scepter, to face Aralshek.
1: Here is by the entrance of the sepulchre.
1: Be very careful, my friend, you will also have to fight his bodyguards.
1: May the Gods help you, foreigner, and save us all...
