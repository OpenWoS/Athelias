1: You should be very careful here, my friend.
1: The barbarians training grounds are also the arena of Irkatshk.
1: The rules are simple: no spells but offensive spells, no heal, no ticket, no protection from PKers.
1: Hit and kill - or die.

1: Welcome among the barbarians of Irkatshk!
H: Thanks.
1: Since you're new here, I guess you don't know a lot about the history of the Barbarians.
1: Once upon a time, the town of Irkatshk was a dwarven outpost in the mountains.
1: The objective of the fighters was to protect the city of Arguazil from the threat of the Chaos minions, and the hoards of orcs and goblins roaming the mountains around.
1: Many were the outposts of this kind then, but all felt during the First Invasion but this one.
1: The dwarven warriors had developed their own war and survival tactics.
1: As time goes by, humans came here in order to learn their skills, and settled down.
1: The Barbarians of Irkatshk never gave up since the creation of the town.
1: We proudly protect the western lands of Athelias from the threat of the evil creatures coming from the mountains.
1: You'll have to train hard if you want to survive your charge.
1: Come back when you think your training make you able to face the dangers a Barbarian has to be confronted with.

1: Welcome back, %1.
1: I may have a task for you.
H: Really?
1: A few weeks ago, the Regent decided to forbid by law any kind of fighting or training that is not overseen by an officer of Prina, which means that we must either quit training or accept the presence of someone watching over us.
1: Of course, we can't accept that.
1: Prina has no right to tell us what to do, nor to spy us.
H: But why did he "vote" such a law?
H: He is crazy!
1: I guess he wants to keep the control over any man able to fight.
1: The Regent has always been paranoid, but it's getting worse - especially after the attempts of rebellion in Prina.
1: We sent an ambassador to Prina, but the Regent refuses to listen to the requests of the Barbarians against the new law.
1: We have no choice: we have decided to break off with the central government of Prina.
1: Irkatshk is now a self-governing town.
H: How did the Regent take it?
1: We have had no feedback yet, but I guess he will just send his army and besiege Irkatshk.
H: ...
1: I would like you to help organize the defence of the town.
1: We must gather our warriors together and find enough supplies to resist the siege of the town.
1: I need you to go to the goblins' cave and find Ernst Sharak, who is on a mission there.
1: We need him and his men.
1: Go and tell him to abandon his mission immediately and return to Irkatshk as soon as possible.
H: For Irkatshk's sake, I will find him.
