1: Welcome, young soul.
1: I can teach you all you need to know about fights and equipment in Athelias.
1: Please, have a seat.
1: Each class in Athelias uses an unique weapon.
1: There are several combinations of equipment.
1: Knights would use a sword and a shield for example, while paladin would only use a two-handed sword.
1: And it's also true for the body gear : mages use robes, paladins tunics, and knights armors.
1: But my fellow teacher will explain you the differences between the classes of Athelias better than I could.
1: Another particularity of Athelias is that most of the weapons or armors cannot be bought in shops.
1: You can have up to 20 different weapons till level 100, every 5 levels, but you can only buy 5 of them : level 1, 20, 40, 60, and 80.
1: Although, you can upgrade these weapons and make them stronger if you go to a blacksmith.
1: Of course, the service will not be free, and you will also have to bring them the metal they need to upgrade the weapon.
1: But beware if you try to upgrade a weapon too often : there is a small chance that the blacksmith breaks it.
1: Note that you can upgrade a weapon only three times.
1: You'll have to buy another one after.
1: Some kinds of equipment cannot be upgraded : 
1: some weapons such as staves and puppets ; some kinds of body gear : tunics, robes, magical paintings.
1: All of them can be bought in shops or are offered as a reward.
1: You cannot buy rings and amulets neither.
1: You can only find them.
1: Some high level equipment you'll get will be a part of a set.
1: You will get a special skill if you have the whole set equipped.
1: You will find informations about these legendary armors in the libraries of the cities.
1: You will notice it in a short while, most of the monsters do not drop gold.
1: You have to gather the items you get after the battle and sell them at a shop in a city to make money.
1: You can also try to get the equipment you need in fighting humanoid monsters that use the weapon or armor you need.
1: For example, if you need a level 20 sword, you can try to get one in fighting knights from level 20 to 39.

1: Or you can just buy it... it's up to you.
1: That's all that I can teach you at the moment.
1: Good luck, adventurer.

1: The classes of Athelias do not have access to all the spells.
1: Their level in every element is limited.
1: And every class get at least one special spell, that no-one else can use.
1: There are class-specific skills as well, but you can also get more skills with quest items or if you wear a full armor set.
1: If you have at least one available skill, a small icon will appear, like this :

1: If you activate a single-use skill, the icon will simply disappear and you won't be able to use it again in the same scene.
1: You will find a description of most of the skills in the libraries of the cities.
1: Oh, and by the way, you may have noticed that all the classes of Athelias can train the skill of any element up to level 3, but can't use the spells.
1: You will understand why later - you just need to know that if your class normally can't use the spells of an element, don't waste your PPs in training it: you won't have access to the spells, even with the level required.
1: I guess I have nothing left to teach you.

1: Welcome to the pokegatchi course, my young friend.
1: Only two classes have a taming spell in Athelias : archers and monks.
1: And as you cannot buy pets (actually healers and death dancers can, but that's exceptions), there are only two ways to get one:
1: Getting it as a reward for a quest, or incubating an egg.
1: Eggs are trophies randomly dropped after a fight that you can incubate to get a pet.
1: As of version 1.25, the following monsters may drop an egg: Thesarian Shell, Thesarian Crab, Fongy, Sage Worm, Toad, Poison Spore, Ticky, Aralian Harpy, Black Ant, Young Ent, Erzog Bear, Gorgona, Minotaur, and Kamikaze Bumblebee. 
1: To incubate it, you'll first need to acquire an incubator from a merchant, like this one.
ACTOR 2, , 2, 0, 38, 95
1: You should head to the tamer of Mangeas or Irkatshk if you're looking for one.
1: Once you have an egg and an incubator, camp, and click on the "Incubator" icon.
ACTOR 3, , buttons, 8, 95, 15
1: Select, "Incubate an egg"; a list of the monsters corresponding to the eggs you have will appear.
1: Right-click on the one you want to incubate, and you're done.
1: But you can also "disincubate" a pet that you don't use but want to keep with an incubator.
1: You can do that from your camp as well.
1: Click on the icon, select the appropriate option, pick a pet, set it free, click again on the icon, and you'll get an egg.
1: Unfortunately, its statistics will be reset if you incubate it again, and it will have the stats it had the first time you got it.
1: Right-click me if you need explanations about the GS pet commands.
