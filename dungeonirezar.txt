1: Free!
1: After so many centuries in the dreamlands, I am free again!
1: Thank you for rescuing me, adventurers.
1: But...
1: I feel a familiar presence...
1: Tell me what's going on!
H: The nine dark paladins have also awaken and they are about to walk over Athelias.
H: They prepare an old ritual and we came here in order to ask you to help us stop them.
1: The nine dark paladins, hmm?!
1: So that's how they are called nowadays, eh!
1: Let me tell you their -our- story.
1: When the Chaos invaded Athelias, the Elders met here and succeeded in uniting the Lords of the Island in the fight.
1: The greatest army of this time raised and we succeeded in pushing away the army of the Chaos.
1: But our victory couldn't be complete.
1: We still had to destroy the demonic artifact that was the source of the power of our enemies.
1: It was kept by their most powerful creatures, hidden in Arkhangal, the first city they invaded.
1: So the greatest heroes of the realm started what should have been the ultimate crusade.
1: The company consisted of a paladin, a knight, a wizard, an illusionist, four elementalists, a death dancer, and a priest.
1: Myself.
1: The Master Blacksmiths of the past ages forged weapons and armours to help us in our quest.
1: Every elementalist also received a magical crystal that multiplied their powers.
1: We fought, and defeated the guardians of the artifact.
1: But the victory was not ours.
1: Our enemy succeeded in taking possession of the spirits of my former companions while we were about to destroy the demonic artifact.
1: I resisted but the soul of my companions was already lost in the realms of the Chaos.
1: I don't know what happened then.
1: I felt unconscious.
1: When I woke up, I was imprisoned here.
1: Bartuc, the jailor, was the rider of paladin of the company.
1: I bet my former companions will gather in Serevan Castle.
1: If I am right they would need an old book of spells hidden in the castle.
1: The castle was Kashgar's, the paladin of the company.
1: You must go and try to stop them there.
1: May this item help you in your journey.
