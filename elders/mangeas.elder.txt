1: So you have decided to be a healer.
1: Good.
1: The members of the sanctuary are the elven priests of Isindra, the goddess of life and healing.
1: They are the keepers of the secrets of the ancient priests of Athelias.
1: No-one else can master the secrets of life as they do.
1: Mangeas is the best place to learn the art of healing.
1: Stay among the elves and seek a master in the sanctuary.
1: May the Gods be with you.

1: So you have chosen to become an archer. 
1: Back in the days, Mangeas housed the most famous archer training camps.
1: But the power of the elves has faded away, and the most skilled archers are now found in the forest of Katadyn.
1: You should go to Katadyn to find master in that art.
1: May your travel be safe.
