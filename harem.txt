1: Hello again, Sir %1.
1: I have another favor to ask.
H: What is it?
1: The roads to the Old World are still closed.
1: The desert is still preyed by the creatures that attempted to besiege Tahamanraset.
1: A caravan must go - I have an important missive to transmit to  the Dukes of Kotor, beyond the desert.
1: I know their cities had been attacked as well and hoards of beastmen still roam the region. 
1: It is time for a new alliance among humans.
1: We must beat off the Chaos all around the Old World; having defeated it in the Desertic Lands is not enough.
1: This is the only way to prevent a new invasion.
H: So you want me to escort the caravan?
1: Yes, %1.
1: I have nothing to offer but I know you don't only fight for gold.
1: Please, do me this favor, for the humankind's sake!
H: I will.
1: Thanks, %1.
1: The caravan will be waiting for you by the Western Gate of Tahamanraset.
