1: Please, have a seat.
1: We have to talk.
1: A revolt broke out at the palace.
1: And the leader was your friend, Makel.
1: The rebels accused the regent of being corrupted.
1: They were arrested and Makel is now in a jail below the palace.
1: But the guards are now looking for you.
1: The regent asked us to hand over you to the guards of the city.
1: But we won't.
1: We will never extradite a member of the guild.
1: But we can't do more.
1: Do what you have to do.
1: You will be in security here.
1: But we cannot protect you outside.
