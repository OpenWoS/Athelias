1: Welcome, adventurer.
1: I heard of your adventures in Thanaris.
1: You did well.
1: But unfortunatly, the Chaos is back, we won't defeat it on our own.
1: A few weeks ago, Medhi, general of the armies of the Tahamanraset, sent an ambassador to Kotor to suggest a new alliance between the Desertic Lands of the Old World.
1: For the sake of the true Gods, Kotor will join Tahamanraset in its struggle against the Chaos.
1: I would like you to escort the plenipotentiary caravan back to Tahamanraset.
1: That's a dangerous trip, but I know you can succeed.
H: I will, my lord.
1: Thank you, %1.

5: Lord Pokerar, I am pleased to met you.
1: So am I...
1: But tell me what Tahamanaris are doing so far from their country - because you are from Tahamanraset, right?
1: And how did you get there?
1: The roads to the Desertic Lands are closed!
5: Yes, we are from Tahamanraset. 
CALL 110012@start %C
5: The roads were closed but thanks to this man, %1, #<arg0> %C from Athelias Island, we succeeded in passing through the perils of such a trip and reached the Old World.
5: We were sent by the Commander of Tahamanraset's army, Medhi, after the defeat of the Chaos troops in the Desertic Lands.
5: He sent us to offer you the support of Tahamanraset and the armies of the Desertic Lands.
5: We know that your realms have to fight the Chaos armies as we did.
5: It is now time for a new alliance among humans.
1: I am as glad as surprised to see you here and hear this.
1: Go and tell Commander Medhi that the Dukes of Kotor would proudly accept his offer and fight by his side.
1: Many people, here as in the Desertic Lands, had to suffer from the threat of the Chaos.
1: May this new alliance terminate this.
