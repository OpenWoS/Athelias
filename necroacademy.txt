1: Hello.
1: Can I do something for you?
H: Yes. My masters from the Illusory Magic Academy asked me to come here and search some information about Lord Jeren.
1: Lord Jeren?!
1: That's very strange : some months ago appeared again an old relic that everyone had forgotten : the Skull of Jeren, and now you're here and ask me about him...
H: A relic?
1: Yes, an old man in Prina found it - don't ask me how - but we succeeded in bringing it back to the Academy to study it.
1: Unfortunately, the fellow necromancer who was in charge of experimenting its powers had his soul corrupted by the Chaos laying in it and summoned an army of undead.
1: He besieged Athalantis and threatened the population, but we succeeded in stopping him and he is now in a jail in Prina.
H: And what about the relic?
1: It is now in the palace of the Regent.
1: We asked him to give it back to the Academy so we can destroy it but he refused.
1: The relationship between the Academy and the Palace are a bit cold at the moment.

2: Hello, Knight. 
1: Lord Ghamyl has very bad news for us.
2: Four weeks ago, the guards of the regent came into Athalantis and wanted Derar to be transferred to the prison of Prina. 
2: But since, the undead walk again in the street of Athalantis and several villages around were attacked by bands of ghouls.
2: It must cease.
2: Derar must be killed.
1: Neither the city of Athalantis nor the Academy can afford to start a war - for the regent won't be willing to send us back Derar.
1: That's why we would like you to go to Prina and solve the problem.
H: Where is he imprisoned?
2: In a jail below the palace of the regent.
H: So basically you want me to go to the palace, fight all the guards of Prina, raid the prison, and kill one of the Masters of the Academy. 
1: That's the idea, yes.

1: You are late, %1!
1: What was I saying?
1: Oh yes : the importance of snake flesh for the preparation of incantations of the 3rd order.
1: The African House Snake is small to medium-sized colubrid snake from Africa.  
1: Although it is commonly called the "African" House Snake in the herpetocultural community, there are at least ten other species in this genus found on the continent.   
1: (There is also an Afalian species and one endemic to the Sprongelles).
1: Lamprophis fuliginosus is a highly variable snake.  
1:  It can be unicolored, spotted, or even striped.   
1: Many individuals are spotted as hatchlings and become unicolored as adults.  
1:  Some adults retain this spotting on the anterior part of the body.   
1: As the common name suggests, they are often brown, ranging from tan to deep chocolate brown.   
1: However, they can also be olive-green, dark-green, orange, brick-red, or even black (in fact, the specific epithet fuliginosus comes from a latin word meaning "black" or "soot").   
1: The ventral scales are pearly white and the whole snake has an iridescence that rivals even such snakes as the Rainbow Boa (Epicrates cenchria).
1: Most L. fuliginosus have a distinct light stripe on each side of the head from the rostrum to the back of the head.   
1: The presence or absence of this stripe has been used to taxonomically distinguish certain populations in the past, but is now simply regarded as part of the snakes geographic variation.  
1:  Some individuals have very broad head stripes, which gives the head a very "boxy" appearance.
