H: Hello, Father.
1: Hello.
1: Is there something I can do for you?
H: Yes.
H: I'm just back from Thanaris.
H: I went to the galleries under the town and found a demon trapped there.
H: Someone from Thanaris told me you know how to destroy it.
1: So you went there...
1: You're probably the only one who has tried to get there for centuries...
1: I think the last hero who tried his luck there was Sir Alanitch - he never came back.
1: About a millennium ago, a Chaos god named Trezerath raised an army of undead and demons and tried to invade the region around Obrovac.
1: Trezerath is the god of night and dreams, and most of his minions practise black magic and necromancy.
1: The Chaos army was led by Tharanel, an avatar of the god himself.
1: That's the creature you've fought.
1: The clerics of yore gathered and enchanted a stone that was supposed to absorb the black magic and repel the Chaos army.
1: The clerics went on the battlefield with the stone, and succeeded in trapping the demon in a sanctuary thanks to its power.
1: But it didn't destroy the undead.
1: It just changed them, changed their nature.
1: The most common undead are not able to think.
1: They're just walking corpses.
1: They built a town on what was the battlefield.
1: The dukes of Obrovac tolerated their existence as they never tried to extend their territory since.
1: But the demonic avatar is still there.
1: No-one could kill him without the power of the Dead Stone.
1: You must find the stone, and use its power against the avatar of Trezerath.
H: But what will happen to the undead of Thanaris without the stone?
1: Nobody knows...
1: You'd better bring it back to the town as soon as you have defeated the avatar...
1: Good luck, adventurer.
1: Farewell.
H: Farewell.
