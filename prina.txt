5: Our order was created soon after the First Invasion of the Chaos to fight the corrupted souls.

5: The institution still exists nowadays and unfortunately, it has no reason to disappear...
H: And what are you doing here?
5: I went to Prina for a mission.
5: I had to get back an old evil relic and bring it to the Assassins Castle.
5: But something went wrong.
5: I've been attacked by several guards of the regent and I am too weak to go back to the castle.
5: I think Prina will be my resting place...
5: But I need to ask you a favour.
H: Yes?
5: Please, take this relic and bring it to the Assassins Castle, on the southern part of the island.
