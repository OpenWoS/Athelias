1: Welcome, %L.
1: Let me teach you your history. 
1: Rodeurs are the descendants of the companions of the last king of Athelias, Argoz.
1: A long time ago, when the chaos was invading Athelias, humans united themselves and raised an immense army under Argoz's banner.
1: This was the ultimate battle, that sealed the destiny of Athelias.
1: Men and chaos creatures kept fighting during two whole days.
1: The soldiers could hardly stand up at the end of the battle.
1: But victory was theirs.
1: But when they thought they had defeated their enemy, the darkness covered the land. 
1: A vortex was opened in the sky and the most dreadful major demon came out of the shadows. 
1: Argoz rushed on the creature and faced it.
1: Then began a terrible duel.
1: Argoz was wounded, and died on the battle field.
1: But while the demon was not ready, he succeeded in putting his sword through its heart. 
1: The battle was won.
1: The creature of chaos were pushed back.
1: But Athelias lost its king.
1: And the victory was short.
1: The chaos soon recovered its power.
1: Men seemed to never be able to win.
1: A regent was appointed to lead the armies : the King was dead childless.
1: Facing the threat of chaos, the regent decided to invoke Thorn, God of blood and war.
1: He knew that by doing that he would curse all of his descendants, but it appeared to be the only solution. 
1: The sword of Thorn was taken out.
1: The regent took the holy cup holding the blood of the god, and drank it, so did his most faithful companions.
1: And together, they leaded the army to the victory.
1: They were fighting with the soul of Thorn.
1: But the human heart is too weak to endure such an ordeal.
1: The regent and his companions needed war, needed blood.
1: Their government became tyrannical.
1: The country was absorbed in brutality.
WAIT 2
1: Some knights were opposed to the regent taking the Sword of Thorn. 
1: King Argoz always refused to come to that extremity, and his men kept their fidelity towards him, even after his death. 
1: As they watched the land get ruled by anger and brutality, they decided to kill the regent and his minions. 
1: They were the worthiest knights of the island, but they had to fight with an avatar of the god of war himself.
1: The fight took place here. Most of the fighters died during the battle.
1: At the end, only three knights and the regent remained.
1: It was as if nothing could stop his shots. 
1: But he stumbled and one of the knights took advantage of it and hit him on the head. 
1: The regent felt down.
1: In a last effort, he took his sword again, and thrust it into the ground. 
1: Nobody succeeded in taking it out since.
1: The temple was built around it, and the sword of Thorn is still here.
1: Rodeurs are the guards of the temple.
1: They are the descendants of these knights, the companions of King Argoz.
1: But another king has never been appointed.
1: The sons of the regent kept ruling over Athelias.
1: Rodeurs keeps waiting, and watching.
1: They know that this family was cursed when the sword of Thorn was taken out.
1: No good may come from them.
