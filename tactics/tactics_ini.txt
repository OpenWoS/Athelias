;
; All available tactics maps for your world are defined in this file
; related assets are found in your world's "tactics" folder. 
; (omit the .bmp on bitmap names and the .wav on sound effect files)
;
; tactics.ini includes the following sections:
;
; [general]    - declares the number of maps in the file
; [tiles]      - declares the appearance and properties of individual map tiles
; [sounds]     - declares all the possible sound effect files.
; [soundsets]  - declares sets of similar sound effect files (the game picks a sound at random from the set)
; [weapons]    - declares available weapons
; [spells]     - declares available spells
; [spellSets]  - declares combinations of spells (a magic user is bound to a particular spell set)
; [pieces]     - declares the available army pieces
; [mapNN]      - one section per map (numbered from 1 to General/numMaps)
;
; ---
;
; 'Movement' values are formed by adding together these values:
;
;    1 - earth  (normal, can walk on dirt)
;    2 - air    (can be flown over)
;    4 - fire   (lava)
;    8 - water  (water)
;
;  so, for example, a movement value of 9 means it can cross earth and water.  15 means it can cross anything.
;
; PIECES and TILES both have movement values, and a piece can cross a tile if it has ANY in common.
; So, generally set the tiles to the sort of thing they are, then give the PIECEs all the bits
; for all the things they can cross (for example, a flying piece probably gets a movement value
; of 15 since it can cross earth, air, fire, and water.  (well, maybe not water)
;
; WEAPONS also have movement values (some weapons may not cross water, for example)
;
; NOTE: ini files do NOT like blank lines in the middle of a section, so if you want
;       to break up the monotony, be sure to start the line with a comment semicolon
;
; NOTE: ini files tend to strip quotes if the value begins or ends with a quote, so add a leading space and a trailing comma where needed
;       (you can generally imitate this file in that regard) (but it boils down to: if the line has more than one field on it, and the final
;        field on the line is quoted, then add a comma at the end.  If that same line starts with a quoted argument, add an extra space after
;        the equal sign.
;


;---------
; these are the COMMON tiles, which *can be overridden* by individual maps
;
; Note the following 'special' tileIds which you must use as described:
;
; 0   - not availble, not drawn, not passable, defines 'border' of map
; 249 - Start location for Red Player (should be a single pixel of this somewhere)
; 250 - Start location of Green Player
; 251 - start location of Yellow Player
; 252 - start location of Blue Player

; These are the COMMON pieces, which can be overridden by individual maps (I might remove that feature)
;
; name   - should be reasonably brief and UPPERCASE (has to fit in info popup)
; bitmap - should use the three special golden colors for areas which are to be dynamically recolored for team color
; max#   - most you can have in a single army (0 for no limit, but 9 is hard max anyway)
; el     - reserved for a future 'element' assignment
; mov    - the piece's movement bits (what tiles it can cross. add together from this table:)
;          1 - earth  (normal, can walk on dirt)
;          2 - air    (can be flown over)
;          4 - fire   (lava)
;          8 - water  (water)
; mob    - mobility (how many steps it can 'walk' in single turn)
; range  - how far your weapon can shoot (also in 'steps' so a shot NW takes two steps, N then W)
;        - note: mobility and range have a hard-limit of '6' to prevent excessive recursion depth
;        - many other attributes are capped around '20' at run time (to prevent divide by zero, oddly enough)
; minRange - you cannot shoot anything within this distance of yourself.
;
; Note those are sound SET ids, not sound ids, in the setXXX columns
; setRdy - what piece says when you click on it
; setGo  - what piece says when it starts to walk
; setAtt - what piece says when it starts attack
; setPain- what piece says when it gets hurt
; setDeath- what piece says when it gets killed
;
; wpn    - weapon id (from WEAPONS section) also implies weapon class (for rock/paper/scissor effect)
; armour - reserved for future armor class

.---------
; The Maps
;
; * Each map has its own section, beginning with [map1]
; * Each map has a 256 color (wos palette) 'bitmap' file where each pixel's color specifies a 'tile' id.
;     several colors are 'reserved' (see [tile] comments), but otherwise have only the meaning you assign them
;
; name            - name of map
; author          - short string descibing YOU (um, really short.  your name.. or less)
; bitmap          - path and name of map BMP in tactics folder (leave off the .bmp)
; elevationBitmap - (optional) bitmap with elevation data (taken from red component of color of pixel) 
;                   must match height/width of map bitmap
; seed            - (optional) random seed value for 'automatic bumpiness' (assumes no elevation bitmap)
; roughness       - (optional) controls roughness of auto-bumpiness. (0 is completely flat)
; requirements    - (optional) WoS conditional ("L3" requires level 3) required for you to HOST map 
;                   (but anyone can PLAY on any map you host, whether they have requirements or not)
;
; Elevation notes:
;
; a piece cannot cross from one tile to another if their elevation difference is 32 or more (up or down)
; a weapon cannot shoot across one tile to another if their elevation difference is 64 or more (up or down)
; air-crossing pieces (and weapons) are exempt from this restriction
; You do NOT have to use elevation.  flat maps are fine.
