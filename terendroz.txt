H: I have defeated the nine dark paladins and now I am here to get rid of their army.
1: Many are the Terendrosis who died during the siege, my young friend.
1: I hope you tell me the truth - too much blood was shed .
1: The major demon that leads the troops opened a vortex to a chaotic dimension.
1: The number of our enemies keeps increasing while our soldiers die.
1: We cannot win as long as this vortex remains opened.
1: And the only way to close it would be to clear a path through the troops of the chaos army and kill the demon...
